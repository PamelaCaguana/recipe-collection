# Recipe Collection README

This is a working project for myself, my family, and anyone else who has ever thought to themselves "What was that really tasty dish I made last month? Did I bookmark it? Was it on youtube? Wait, did I screen shot the recipe? Did I really take 1000 photos in the last month? Nevermind I'll just do take out again."

Because making your own food shouldn't require a google deep dive.

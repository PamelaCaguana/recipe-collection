# Recipe Collection

This is a working project for myself, my family, and anyone else who has ever thought to themselves "What was that really tasty dish I made last month? Did I bookmark it? Was it on youtube? Wait, did I screen shot the recipe? Did I really take 1000 photos in the last month? Nevermind I'll just do take out again."

It uses the MERN stack with google authentication. It started off as a vanilla JS project for funsies but since it has been pretty useful to me it has become a working app. I will be updating it with jwt, pagination, comments, and search amongst other things.

Please check back for an improved README as well. Coming soon!
